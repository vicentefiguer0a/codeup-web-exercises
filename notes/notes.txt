true and 'true' are NOT the same thing, even though it looks like it at first glance.
The first true is a boolean, which has a value of either true or false.
The second 'true' is a string, which is just a combination of letters/symbols/numbers next to each other that hold no value.

When trying to find the index of "c" in the string "Hello Codeup" using the ".indexOf()" method, I get an output of "-1". That is because if the given character or 
substring is not found, the indexOf() method will return a negative number.

"use strict" is added at the very top of JavaScript code to apply the stricter rules which then will make scripts more reliable
and easier to debug. Make sure to add to JavaScript code FROM NOW ON.
